Cml

$ git clone https://github.com/JazzBrown1/jazzy-authenticate.git

$ cd jazzy-authenticate/examples/basicAuth

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Send some GET requests to http://localhost:3001/get-some-info and http://localhost:3001/get-other-info. Postman is a good tool for this!

```sh
username: user,
password: password
```

Hack away!
